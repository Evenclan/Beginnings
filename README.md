# Beginnings
training with HTML and Sass 

This is my first "bigger" project I've ever made. Simple one page website as an introduction to HTML 5 symantics class naming, @media querries, sass '$' variables, floats, pseudo classes ::before / ::after and more.

Nothing fancy, but I'm as my first project - I'm happy with the result.
